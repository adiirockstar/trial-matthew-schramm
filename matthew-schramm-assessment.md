## Rubric Evaluation

| Category | Score (0–5) | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Context Handling** | **4** | Retrieves Pinecone results and falls back when no relevant documents are found, then builds context-aware prompts【F:src/app/api/chat/route.ts†L46-L119】 |
| **Agentic Thinking** | **4** | Supports five conversation modes via specialized prompting for interview, storytelling, summaries, bragging, and self-reflection【F:src/lib/prompt.ts†L1-L15】 |
| **Use of Personal Data** | **4** | Dataset seeded with resume, portfolio, transcript, and literature review PDFs【53262e†L1-L2】 |
| **Build Quality** | **4** | Codebase is organized with ingestion pipeline and admin UI, but ingestion endpoint runs shell commands without safeguards【F:src/app/api/ingest/route.ts†L26-L76】 |
| **Voice & Reflection** | **4** | System prompt enforces concise tone and self-reflection guidance【F:src/lib/prompt.ts†L1-L7】 |
| **Bonus Effort** | **4** | Extras include an admin panel with dataset manager and file upload UI for ingesting documents【F:src/components/AdminPanel.tsx†L32-L112】 |
| **AI Build Artifacts** | **4** | README documents prompts and iterative collaboration with AI agents【F:README.md†L280-L304】 |
| **RAG Usage (Optional)** | **5** | Embeds queries, searches Pinecone, and cites sources, with fallback when context is missing【F:src/app/api/chat/route.ts†L46-L120】 |
| **Submission Completeness** | **5** | Candidate provided live demo, repo, and walkthrough video in the submission email【F:email-matthew-schramm.md†L7-L11】 |

**Total Score:** **38 / 45**

## Critical Feedback & Suggestions

### Ingestion endpoint runs shell commands without safeguards
The `/api/ingest` route executes `npm run ingest` directly and exposes verbose stdout/stderr over an unauthenticated API, increasing the risk of command injection or denial of service【F:src/app/api/ingest/route.ts†L26-L76】

**Suggestions**
- Require authentication/authorization before triggering ingestion.
- Offload ingestion to a background job queue rather than `exec`.
- Sanitize log output before sending it to clients.

### Verbose logging in chat API may leak user data
The chat route logs raw queries and match metadata to the console, which could reveal user content if deployed in production【F:src/app/api/chat/route.ts†L47-L65】

**Suggestions**
- Guard console logs behind an environment check and avoid logging full user messages.
- Use structured logging with PII redaction for metrics instead of raw logs.

### Admin interface lacks authentication
The admin page and dataset management components are accessible without any auth checks, enabling unauthorized uploads or ingestion runs【F:src/app/admin/page.tsx†L1-L18】【F:src/components/DatasetManager.tsx†L62-L93】

**Suggestions**
- Add NextAuth or token-based authentication for `/admin` and related API routes.
- Validate credentials server-side before allowing file operations or ingestion triggers.

### Chat client does not support streaming or cancellation
`ChatService.sendMessage` waits for full responses, so the UI cannot show partial output or stop requests once sent【F:src/lib/chat-service.ts†L30-L49】

**Suggestions**
- Implement Server-Sent Events or `ReadableStream` to stream tokens.
- Use `AbortController` to allow user-triggered cancellation.

### No automated tests or evaluation harness
The README lists unit tests and evaluation harness as future work, reducing confidence in maintainability【F:README.md†L281-L290】

**Suggestions**
- Add Jest or Vitest unit tests for ingestion and prompting utilities.
- Provide a simple API smoke test script and consider an evaluation harness for answer faithfulness.
